# Java Hangman App
## Overview

For this project, I wanted to learn how mobile apps are developed and how android studio works. I also thought it would be really cool to have an app on my phone
that I've made myself! I had fun when learning Java in a previous project, so I wanted more practice as well.

This app will let you play a game of hangman. It has 3 screens. On the first, you enter a word you want the player to guess. When you submit your word, it will take
you to the second screen where somebody else can try to guess the word you entered. This second screen shows how many incorrect guesses you have, as well as draws
the hangman as you continue to guess incorrectly. This screen will also show you which letters you have guessed. It won't accept more than one character and won't
let you enter the same letter you've guessed before. If the player finishes the word, or the hangman drawing is completed, it will take the player to the next screen
with a win or lose message and the option to play again.

I wanted to create this app mostly to have more practice with Java, but I also wanted an app that I can see myself using in the future. I already have another
hangman app on my phone, but it has ads that interrupt the game. I want to create a simple hangman experience for myself that I can play with others without the
fluff other apps have.

## Development Environment

I used Android Studio as my IDE.
Git and Github were used to publish this app.

Java was the language used to create this app.

## Future Work

* Change input options so that the word you are trying to guess can't have numbers or special chars
* Make buttons for each letter of the alphabet that dissapear as you guess them
* Publish app on the Play Store
